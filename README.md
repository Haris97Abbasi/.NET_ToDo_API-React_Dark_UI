# My Todo App - ASP.NET Core Web API with React Frontend

## Introduction
Welcome to My Todo App, a fully functional CRUD application that elegantly blends the robust backend capabilities of ASP.NET Core Web API with the dynamic and responsive frontend designed in React. This project serves as a showcase of my ability to integrate two powerful technologies to create a seamless full-stack application, meeting the demands of modern web development and aligning with industry standards.

## Features
- **Robust Backend**: Built using ASP.NET Core Web API, the backend is engineered to handle complex data operations, ensuring fast and reliable responses. It serves as the backbone of the application, managing the logic and database interactions efficiently.
- **React Frontend**: The user interface is crafted using React, providing a dynamic and smooth user experience. React's state management capabilities make the UI highly responsive and interactive.
- **CRUD Functionality**: Users can create, read, update, and delete todo items, demonstrating full CRUD operations which are fundamental to modern web applications.
- **SQL Server Database**: All data is persisted in a Microsoft SQL Server database, emphasizing the applicationâ€™s capability to work with robust and scalable database systems.
- **Dark Theme UI**: Implements a modern dark theme UI, which is not only trendy but also easier on the eyes, enhancing user experience especially in low-light environments.
- **Material-UI (MUI) Components**: Leveraging MUI for the frontend design, the application sports a sleek, modern look that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. MUI components have been utilized to ensure that the interface is intuitive and accessible.

## Technologies Used
- **ASP.NET Core Web API**: For building a powerful, scalable backend.
- **React.js**: Used for building the interactive frontend.
- **Microsoft SQL Server**: As the relational database to store data.
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: For designing a clean and modern interface with a responsive layout.
